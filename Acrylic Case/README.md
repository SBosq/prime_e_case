 Prime E Case Files

This is the repo for our modded Prime_E files based off the [Nabi design](https://github.com/FrancisUsher/nabi-case)

Each File needs to be cut once, and the design uses m2x8 round standoffs and m2x8 and m2x12 screws. More pictures can be seen at [our website](https://www.p3dstore.com/shop/p/acrylic-prime-e-case)
